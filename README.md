CSU Wearables Team: The Depth Perception Buddy

NASA funded project

Team members: Vanessa Montoya, Daiana Bilbao, Melanie Blake

Depth perception is the ability to perceive the world in three dimensions (3D) & judge the distance of objects. Individuals with no or inaccurate depth perception encounter difficulty in doing daily tasks such as walking from place to place, going up and downstairs, and avoiding hazardous terrain like objects, potholes, curbsides and differences in ground levels. The goal of our wearable project, The Depth Perception Buddy, is to serve as a tool that empowers users to live their lives with confidence & independence in each step they take while our advanced technology takes care of the rest by alerting users of potentially hazardous terrain that may cause them serious injury or physical trauma. Our approach was to create a convenient & discrete alternative to having a guide dog or walking stick so that the user could live as independently as possible. Our first idea was to create an anklet wearable device however, it ended up not being ideal since the sensor was unintentionally affected by the movement of the foot and leg. Our result product was, The Depth Perception Buddy, a wearable waistband alerting device which has 6 attached sensors for detecting objects & hazardous terrains, 3 vibration motors attached for alerting the user, & itâ€™s able to alert the user within 100 cm to be able to change action. The Depth Perception Buddy is a prototype solution that prevents unwanted injuries from happening to the user as well as gives the user the independence they deserve.
